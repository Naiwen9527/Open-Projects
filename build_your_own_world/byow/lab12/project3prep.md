# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: It contains less hierarchical structures and more straightforward, although not as abstract as it could be. The lesson I learnt is that for larger and more complex data structures, I should fully implement the idea of abstraction.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: I think the hexagons might be blocks to build the indoor space. Tesselation would be the wall plus the wall, and different types of tile would be analogous to different sort of hexagons.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would be starting with the basic building block, namely to start building just one "hexagon".

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: Hallway only contains one row of floor tiles, whereas a room contains a large rectangular space of floor tiles.
